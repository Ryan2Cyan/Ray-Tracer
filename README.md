# Ray Tracer

Primitive ray tracer developed as a first year university project. Delves into how a</br>
ray tracers work coincide with a camera, as well as my first introduction to the common matrix</br>
mathematics present in 3D applications (like video games) - for example: camera and world space</br>
conversion matricies.</br>

Submitted as an assignment project at Bournemouth University (2021). </br>
